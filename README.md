This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Things that matter to me and are important for this project

You have a structured approach to organizing code based on whether it's used in client-side or server-side components. You prefer to keep client-side logic, such as fetching and displaying data, encapsulated within custom hooks in the Hooks folder. For server-side logic, you use asynchronous functions, which are stored in the lib folder, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and enhancing code maintainability. This demonstrates your attention to detail and efficient use of hooks and async functions in Next.js development.
